			<h2 class="section-title">From Paradise to Silicon Valley</h2>
			<div class="about-content">
				<p>
					My journey began in one of the most beautiful places on
					Earth‚ÄîMah√©, Seychelles. Born on this tropical paradise in the
					Indian Ocean, I was surrounded by pristine beaches, crystal-clear
					waters, and a culture that values both innovation and tradition.
					This unique beginning shaped my perspective on problem-solving
					and creativity, teaching me to think differently and approach
					challenges from multiple angles.
				</p>

				<div class="highlight-card">
					<h3>üèùÔ∏è Island Roots, Global Vision</h3>
					<p>
						Growing up in Seychelles instilled in me a unique blend of
						patience, creativity, and adaptability‚Äîqualities that prove
						invaluable in the ever-evolving world of web development.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					The transition from island life to the fast-paced world of
					technology wasn't just a geographical move‚Äîit was a complete
					transformation. Yet, the core values of community, attention to
					detail, and sustainable thinking that I learned in Seychelles
					continue to influence how I approach every project today.
