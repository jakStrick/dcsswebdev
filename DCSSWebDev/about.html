    <h1>Welcome Jak's Wacky Adventure Stories</h1>
    <p>
        Here are all my zigs... short stories that I use as reminders of what not to do, and also, In an effort to help you avoid falling into the same pitfalls. I offer no
        advice on "zags" but if I could say one thing, it is this -- it is what most anyone who has come through the shit and pumped on through to
        the otherside would say--it is
        the one and only thing you need to remember and it is the one and only thing that matters -- and it is to: <span>NEVER, EVER, EVER GIVE UP!!</span> If you
        remember this, all the zigs in your life will, in fact, turn out to be meaningless.<br><br>

        Bad advice is something that can only come from having had things go so terribly wrong that when it was all over -- you were dead broke, homeless and living in your car...
        your only possession and even that was not guaranteed. Now remember, what you read here is bad advice so probably doing the opposite will bring
        you better luck.<br>
    </p>
        <h4>Disclaimer:</h4>
    <p>
        This advice is not meant or implied to teach you or have you do or follow any of it. It is here merely and purely as a means of commical relief
        at my expense and for your enjoyment; stemming from my bad fortunes and thus, hopefully, for a laugh or two... that's it.
