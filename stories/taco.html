    <h1>The Taco Incident</h1>
    <p>

        When I was 22, For about a year and a half, I dated a young half Czechoslovakian and half Mexican beauty. She had barely turned 18, had the most
        lucious black curly hair that draped down her back like a crescenda. She stood about 5 foot 7 and I was in love.



        One Friday she invited me to her Christmas party... she worked for Farms Ins company and it was their annual holiday shin-dig.


        she left an indelible scare on my heart, lingers to this day.
